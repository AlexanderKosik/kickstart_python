# What is this?
This is a 12 week programm for the python programming language. 

## Target audience
This course targets people interested in the programming language `python`. No prior knowledge of the language is needed. Basic IT knowledge of your operation system (installing software, setting environment variables) is needed to setup your system.

It is an advantage if you have basic knowledge of other programming languages.

## Structure
This kickstart programm is divided in 12 chapters. Read one chapter per week and do the corresponding exercises of the chapter.

Every chapter has at least one exercise. The exercises build up on each other and have a unique name (e.g. Ex3a1, Ex3a2, Ex3a3, Ex3b1). The name Ex3a1 stands for "Exercise for chapter 3, alternative 'a', exercise number 1). The 'a' stands for exercise path A. Beginn with exercises from path 'a' and continue the path until you have solved all exercises for the chapter. 

If you have problems and cannot solve Ex3a1 have a look at the solution folder. Try to solve the exercise after looking at the solution. Then try to solve an alternative exercise ('b', 'c', ...) if available.
