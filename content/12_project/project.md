# Project

In the last chapter we want to dive into the topic of **Cellular Automatons**. 

The topic consists of multiple parts. The goal is to have a running instance of *Game of Life*. Feel free to extend the game as described in later chapters. 

You will find the Project overview [here](../../exercises/week12/overview.md).
